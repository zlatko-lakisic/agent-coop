# Cursor

Agent name: `cursor`

Can drive: yes

Joins with: rule

Project files for: members

Hooks: todo

Read-only lock: todo

Background runs: yes

Status: untested

Project rule only (loads every turn). TODO: hook format for Cursor is not verified, so hooks are not installed. TODO: detection paths per OS are not confirmed. The command is agent, installed into ~/.local/bin. cursor-agent is the older name. https://cursor.com/docs/cli/installation Flags confirmed at https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/parameters : -p, --trust, --workspace, --model, --mode ask. Scheduled runs never pass --force, -f, or --yolo. Before a driver run, Agent Co-op writes <worktree>/.cursor/cli.json so the agent may read broadly, write only the worktree and the board, and run git, agentcoop, and the commands in driver_shell_allow. Before a helper run, it writes <board>/projects/<project>/.cursor/cli.json with Read(**) allowed and Write(**) and Shell(*) denied. Permissions: https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/permissions A person's ~/.cursor/cli-config.json may also hold permissions. How the two files combine is not documented, so keep broad allow rules out of the global file.

See AGENTS-SUPPORT.md for the full table. Open questions there are not guesses.
